# TaskFlow API - Senior Backend Engineer Coding Challenge

First of all build the application but while running command build it gives error.
So I manually installed the respected modules of nestjs.
After that while ruuning the api for regsistering the user it was giving 500 interval server in response.
So I added the env JWT SECRET KEY value in .env file and respectively fixed the code.
Next creating the task api it was giving dueDate error while passing in API paramater.
As it should passed as IsISO8601 format so I fixed the code.
